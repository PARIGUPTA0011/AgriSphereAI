Crop Recommendation, Price Prediction, and Disease Detection Models

This repository contains three models aimed at enhancing decision-making in the agricultural domain. The first two models—Crop Recommendation and Crop Price Prediction—are built using machine learning techniques. They help in recommending the most suitable crops for cultivation based on environmental factors and predict the future prices of crops to assist farmers in making better financial decisions. The third model, Crop Disease Detection, is built using computer vision techniques with YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to identify diseases in crops based on image inputs.

Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for the agricultural community by leveraging machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) techniques. The project consists of three models:

Crop Recommendation: Recommends the best crops to cultivate based on soil conditions, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
Crop Price Prediction: Predicts future crop prices to aid farmers and stakeholders in making better economic decisions.
Crop Disease Detection: Detects and classifies diseases in crop images using YOLO, allowing for early identification and treatment of diseases.
Models Overview

Crop Recommendation

The Crop Recommendation model uses classic machine learning algorithms to predict the best-suited crops for a given environment. The model takes into consideration several environmental factors, such as:

Soil type
Temperature
Humidity
Rainfall
This helps farmers to maximize their yield by selecting crops that are well-suited to their local environmental conditions.

Crop Price Prediction

The Crop Price Prediction model uses historical price data to predict future prices for various crops. It is built using machine learning algorithms that analyze patterns in past prices, market trends, and external factors like weather conditions, inflation, etc.

Key features of this model include:

Historical price analysis
Market trend prediction
Forecasting future prices based on external factors
Crop Disease Detection

The Crop Disease Detection model uses YOLO (You Only Look Once), a powerful real-time object detection algorithm. It helps in identifying crop diseases from images by detecting patterns and symptoms of diseases in plants. This model is highly beneficial for farmers to:

Identify diseases early
Take appropriate action for treatment
Prevent crop damage and yield loss
The YOLO-based model ensures real-time and accurate detection with minimal delay.

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for ML models)
